## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14.0.0 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mozzam123/GraphQL-Advanced

### Usage
You can interact with the GraphQL API using a tool like Apollo Client, Postman, or by making HTTP requests directly.

#### Example Queries
Here are some example GraphQL queries you can run:

- Fetch all games:
```
{
  games {
    id
    title
    platform
  }
}

```

- Fetch a specific game by ID:

 ```
{
  game(id: "1") {
    id
    title
    platform
  }
}
 ```

- Add a new game:

 ```
mutation {
  addGame(game: { title: "New Game", platform: ["PS4", "Xbox"] }) {
    id
    title
    platform
  }
}
 ```

- Update a game:
 ```
mutation {
  updateGame(id: "1", edits: { title: "Updated Game" }) {
    id
    title
  }
}
```

- Delete a game:
```
mutation {
  deleteGame(id: "1") {
    id
    title
  }
}
```
